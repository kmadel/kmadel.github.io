      <description>2-21-93 Last night I drank some pretty rough 190 proof alcohol, to what point I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly certain. Basically just to get obliterated and loose my mind; and as an extra, to wake up with the hangover that doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to go away.
Found out that we&amp;rsquo;re leaving CAX on the 23rd, hopefully late. If it&amp;rsquo;s late, then that means an extremely short work week, with a 96 starting on the 25th.</description>

      <description>3-3-93 That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of threes, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you say. Not more than three weeks ago, I told myself, &amp;ldquo;Kurt, things are going to change. You are going to start being a doer, and not just a dreamer.&amp;rdquo; Everybody dreams, but few do. It feels funky, wrong, bad being a secretary with fervent military interests. Sitting on one&amp;rsquo;s ass all day sap&amp;rsquo;s the mollasses right out of you. A good day needs to be balanced between mental &amp;amp; physical / subjective &amp;amp; objective activities.</description>
