      <description>9-11-93 Part Two It&amp;rsquo;s been almost an entire new day since I wrote early in the morning of this same date. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a rather uneventful day and have just risen from an evening slumber. Earlier in the day I picked up a book at the library, Dostoevsky&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;The Adolescent&amp;rsquo;, and I am presently once again in the library with this book, about to delve upon its unfolding truths and to attempt to decipher Dostoevsky&amp;rsquo;s genius.</description>

      <description>9-26-93 I am once again an inhabitant of Camp Schwab. My Company returned late on the night of the 23rd, and has now settled in quite nicely to the way things went prior to Fuji. Of course things are never EXACTLY the same. OurThe commanding officer of our company has initiated his very own personally modified United States Marine Corps Dress Code. By order of Capt G.A. Uribe, all personnel in Co F, 2nd Bn, 4th Mar will at all time except when PTing or in the barracks, wear a collared shirt.</description>

      <description>9-11-93 Never did finish reading &amp;lsquo;Moby Dick&amp;rsquo;. Melville&amp;rsquo;s vernacular might as well be Japanese. Rather than try to figure out Herman&amp;rsquo;s enigmatic language, I went for the easy thrill by reading John Grisham&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;The Pelican Brief&amp;rsquo;. Nothing too deep, but entertaining never the less. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s a best seller and Melville died poor. The general public likes the easy thrill, an easy break from the rat race. I lost my frame of thought because I had to shit.</description>

      <description>2-21-93 Last night I drank some pretty rough 190 proof alcohol, to what point I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly certain. Basically just to get obliterated and loose my mind; and as an extra, to wake up with the hangover that doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to go away.
Found out that we&amp;rsquo;re leaving CAX on the 23rd, hopefully late. If it&amp;rsquo;s late, then that means an extremely short work week, with a 96 starting on the 25th.</description>

      <description>3-3-93 That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of threes, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you say. Not more than three weeks ago, I told myself, &amp;ldquo;Kurt, things are going to change. You are going to start being a doer, and not just a dreamer.&amp;rdquo; Everybody dreams, but few do. It feels funky, wrong, bad being a secretary with fervent military interests. Sitting on one&amp;rsquo;s ass all day sap&amp;rsquo;s the mollasses right out of you. A good day needs to be balanced between mental &amp;amp; physical / subjective &amp;amp; objective activities.</description>
