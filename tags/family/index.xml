      <description>2-21-93 Last night I drank some pretty rough 190 proof alcohol, to what point I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly certain. Basically just to get obliterated and loose my mind; and as an extra, to wake up with the hangover that doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to go away.
Found out that we&amp;rsquo;re leaving CAX on the 23rd, hopefully late. If it&amp;rsquo;s late, then that means an extremely short work week, with a 96 starting on the 25th.</description>
