      <description>9-11-93 Part Two It&amp;rsquo;s been almost an entire new day since I wrote early in the morning of this same date. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a rather uneventful day and have just risen from an evening slumber. Earlier in the day I picked up a book at the library, Dostoevsky&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;The Adolescent&amp;rsquo;, and I am presently once again in the library with this book, about to delve upon its unfolding truths and ~to~ attempt to decipher Dostoevsky&amp;rsquo;s genius.</description>

      <description>9-11-93 Never did finish reading &amp;lsquo;Moby Dick&amp;rsquo;. Melville&amp;rsquo;s vernacular might as well be Japanese. Rather than try to figure out Herman&amp;rsquo;s enigmatic language, I went for the easy thrill by reading John Grisham&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;The Pelican Brief&amp;rsquo;. Nothing too deep, but entertaining never the less. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s a best seller and Melville died poor. The general public likes the easy thrill, an easy break from the rat race. I lost my frame of thought because I had to shit.</description>
