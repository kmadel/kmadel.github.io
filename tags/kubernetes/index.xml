      <title>Tekton: Standardizing Native Kubernetes Continuous Delivery</title>

      <description>Perhaps the most exciting project that was announced as one of the four initial Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) projects is Tekton Pipelines, which in the vein of the Kubernetes ecosystem naming conventions is from the Ancient Greek word for carpenter. It is also the youngest of the four initial CDF projects. Surrounded by industry stalwarts with Jenkins on one side and Spinnaker the other - and then there is the upstart Jenkins X that is just over a year old, but seems much much older in tech years compared to Tekton.</description>

      <title>Just-in-Time Autoscaling for Jenkins Agents with Kubernetes</title>

      <description>In Part 2 of the series CI/CD on Kubernetes we set up cluster autoscaling for a dedicated Jenkins agent node pool by utilizing the PodNodeSelector and LimitRanger admission controllers. In Part 3 of this CI/CD on Kubernetes series we will take advantage of another admission controller to scale-up the Jenkins agents node pool before a new request for a Jenkins agent pod requires the additional capacity. In other words, we want to initiate scaling-up of the Jenkins agent node pool before it is actually needed.</description>

      <description>In Part 1 of the series CI/CD on Kubernetes we used the PodNodeSelector admission controller to segregate the Jenkins workloads - agents from masters (and from any other workload running on the cluster). In Part 2 of this CI/CD on Kubernetes series we will utilize the segregated jenkins-agents node pool as part of an autoscaling solution for the Jenkins agent workload, without impacting the availability or performance of the Jenkins masters node pool or any other segregated workload on the cluster.</description>

      <title>Segregating Jenkins Agents on Kubernetes</title>

      <description>This is the first part in the series CI/CD on Kubernetes. In this part we will explore the use of Kubernetes Namespaces and the Kubernetes PodNodeSelector Admission Controller to segregate Jenkins agent workloads from the Jenkins server (or master) workloads - as well as other workloads on the Kubernetes cluster. As we continue on with the series we will see why this will serve as an important foundation for managing Kubernetes configuration for Jenkins agent related features such as autoscaling, resource quotas and security constraints.</description>
