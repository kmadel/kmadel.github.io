      <description>9-26-93 I am once again an inhabitant of Camp Schwab. My Company returned late on the night of the 23rd, and has now settled in quite nicely to the way things went prior to Fuji. Of course things are never EXACTLY the same. OurThe commanding officer of our company has initiated his very own personally modified United States Marine Corps Dress Code. By order of Capt G.A. Uribe, all personnel in Co F, 2nd Bn, 4th Mar will at all time except when PTing or in the barracks, wear a collared shirt.</description>
